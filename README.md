# ML_Assignment
This project is an implementation of a basic/ functional ML pipeline. The dataset is from kaggle (Mobilephone Dataset 2025).

# Problem Statement

Primary Task Topic
You are the newly appointed data scientist of the company. For a chosen business problem,
you are required to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook. Your
designed and implemented pipeline will be submitted to the team lead data scientist of the
company.
The notebook should contain the following information:
- A problem statement that elaborates the task. For example, what is the underlying
business problem and why is it important? How solving this problem will benefit the
company? How would you collect relevant data? How would you formulate this problem
as a machine learning task?
- A data exploration discussion on the characteristics of the given dataset. For exam-
ple, does the dataset suffer from any data quality issues? Does the dataset require any
sampling or balancing techniques? Which evaluation metrics fit this dataset?
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering steps to prepare the dataset for learning.
- A model training step to select the best machine learning algorithm and tune its hyper-
parameters.
- A model assessment step to evaluate the final performance of the best trained model on
an unseen test set.
- A final discussion on the overall pipeline. For example, what are the overall strengths
and limitations of the proposed solution? What are the implications of the results for the
business problem? What are your data-driven recommendations for solving the initial
business probl
